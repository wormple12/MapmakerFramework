# MapmakerFramework

Framework/Interfaces for different methods of drawing and interacting with a land map, specially designed with video game world maps (fantasy setting or otherwise) in mind.

Vision:
-----------------
You can open this tool in two different capacities; as an editor or as a viewer.
As an editor, you should be able to
  - draw landmasses, split them into individual regions, and indicate biomes for each area;
  - draw roads, routes and rivers;
  - place different types of landmarks (e.g. cities, dungeons, shrines, safehouses, zombie hives);
  - enter and edit informative data about any region or landmark on the map;

As a viewer, you should be able to
  - view the map and select any region or landmark to open a popup box with informative data about it;
  - place markers and notes anywhere on the map, and move them around (this could include a player's current position).

Extra optional features:
  - Editor can create/upload local maps for landmarks that viewers can access.
  - Editor can change visibility for landmarks and information, or can give different viewers specific levels of access.
-----------------

Course relevant subjects to explore in the project:
- Wishful programming
- Design patterns
- Event-based programming (Observer design pattern + Producer/consumer design pattern)
- Reflection + annotations
- Streams

Implementations of the framework could for instance be created with Processing 3 or as a simple continuation of Tobias Grundtvig's 2DApp framework.
